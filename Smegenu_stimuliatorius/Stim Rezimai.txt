tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation)
	Current amplitude	The value range for Amplitude is between 100μA and 5000μA.

tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation)
	Current amplitude
	Frequency		600Hz max
	Offset			The offset parameter is only available for tACS.
	Envelope Amplitude	Envelope amplitude is the depth of modulation of the tACS signal
	Envelope Frequency 	f/2, but not higher than 100Hz max

2 The stimulation phase is normal stimulation. 1180768  ms of stimulation remain. Measured current is 1990 μA, offset is -1 μA, voltage is 8.7 V and impedance is 4.4 kΩ. Error code is 0 – meaning no errors. Mode is sham mode.
The stimulation phase is normal stimulation. 1000 ms of stimulation remain. Measured current is 2000 μA, offset is 100 μA, voltage is 14.0 V and impedance is 7.0 kΩ. Error code is 0 – meaning no errors. Mode is sham mode.
:STIM:CNCL 		Stop with fade-out (remember the single trailing space)
:STIM:STOP 		Stop without fade-out (remember the single trailing space)
